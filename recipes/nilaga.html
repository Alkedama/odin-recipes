Ingredients:
<ul>
    <li> 500 grams beef (preferably stewing beef), cut into cubes</li>
    <li> 2 potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
    <li> 1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li> 2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li> 1 medium-sized cabbage, chopped into large pieces</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons fish sauce (or to taste)</li>
    <li> Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li> Water</li>
    <li> Optional: whole black peppercorns, bay leaves</li>
</ul>
Steps:
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and saut√© until the onions become
        translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>

    <li>Add the beef cubes to the pot and cook until they brown slightly on all sides. This helps enhance the flavor of
        the dish.</li>

    <li> Pour enough water into the pot to cover the beef. If desired, you can also add a few whole black peppercorns
        and bay leaves for added flavor. Bring the water to a boil.</li>

    <li> Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the beef simmer for about 1 to 2 hours, or until it becomes
        tender. Skim off any impurities or foam that rise to the surface during simmering.</li>

    <li>Once the beef is tender, add the potatoes to the pot and continue simmering until they are cooked through and
        soft.</li>

    <li> Next, add the cabbage to the pot and let it cook for about 5 minutes or until it becomes tender but still
        slightly crisp. Adding the cabbage towards the end helps retain its freshness and texture.</li>

    <li> Season the dish with fish sauce, salt, and pepper according to your taste preferences. Adjust the seasoning as
        needed.</li>

    <li> Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to let the flavors meld together. Check the seasoning one final time and
        make any necessary adjustments.</li>

    <li> Remove the pot from the heat and serve the beef nilaga hot. It is commonly enjoyed with steamed rice.</li>
